How is an AI model fed with data?
Synthetic data is artificially generated data that mimics real-world data for use in machine learning, testing or data analysis.
Usage control is essential for data economy and is an extension of access control.
Interoperable connectors enable cross-domain, cross-country, and cross-organization data exchange.
The interoperability on an international scale is demonstrated in the following overview drawing, which illustrates Data Space 1 (Domain A, Economic Area K) and Data Space 2 (Domain B, Economic Area L).
Trust anchor is researched by Prof. Tezuka of Keio University.
